==========

The main point of this project is to allow partner programs to enter those [Universal Data Elements](https://www.hudexchange.info/hmis/hmis-data-and-technical-standards/#elements) required by HUD. As such, it is currently not and does not try to be a full homeless management information system (HMIS) as specified by HUD.

As noted by HUD:

> Universal data elements enable the HMIS the ability to record unique, unduplicated client records, establish participation in a project within a date range, and identify clients who meet time criteria for chronic homelessness.
